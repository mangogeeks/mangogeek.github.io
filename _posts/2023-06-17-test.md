## WHERE

`WHERE`  is primarily a filtering criteria for the rows. Its key features are as follows:

- Performing one or more condition checks on the rows
- Determining the records to keep vs those records to remove from the table being queried
- Applicable for the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements

This condition can be applied by using multiple operators, such as:

- `=, >, < , >=, <=`
- `<> or !=`
- `BETWEEN`
- `LIKE`
- `IN ( [LIST] )`
- `AND, OR and NOT`

Hence, the above operators are used to set filters on rows according to the column(s) value by using the **`WHERE`** condition. He also used certain basic examples of sales, customer order, and students to explain the usage.

👉🏿 What would be the result of the following statement?

`SELECT '54' > 'a’`

**Feedback:**

*The string values are converted to integer values before evaluation, as the operator used is ‘>’. The ASCII value of ‘a’ is 97. Therefore, the statement transforms to ‘select 54 > 97’, which is false. False is converted to 0 in the numeric format.*

# SQL Concepts-2

The key difference between WHERE and HAVING is as follows:

- `WHERE` is applied on filtering rows based on column values, whereas
- `HAVING` is used to apply a filter on an aggregated field.

Further, **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** are used for aggregation of the data. The data can be transformed into various groups based on the conditions defined and can be indicated against each row’s aggregated values. 

The following types of aggregation are mainly used:

- `COUNT() or COUNT(DISTINCT )`
- `MIN() or MAX()`
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`
- `STDDEV()`
- `GROUP_CONCAT()`

With this, you understood the syntax for all the aggregations. But, as it is relatively new, the syntax for `GROUP_CONCAT` is as follows:

`GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT expression ORDER BY expression SEPARATOR sep` )

### **SET operations:**

- **Perform vertical stacking** of the tables.
    - Different types of set operations can be applied based on the requirement and need. `UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT`, and `MINUS` are some of the set operations.
    - The concept was elaborated by taking two tables represented as **Table 1 (3 rows, 3 columns) and Table 2 (2 rows, 3 columns)** in the following manner:
    
   
![Step1 1](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/66b209a9-accf-4215-8416-211f70390678)
    

**The following are the operations applied on the two tables:**

**Union all** - **Both tables are combined together irrespective of them being common**. In the image given below, you can see that there are five rows in total and the yellow row is presented twice as it exists in both the tables.


![Step2](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/66582505-be55-4eb3-9e30-d1b47fdd80fe)

**Union**: Rows of both tables are combined together. But if there are common rows between the tables, it is inserted only once (No Duplicates). In the following image, you can see that there are four rows in total and the yellow row is present only once, unlike in the **Union All.**


![Step3](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/cca2e13e-de91-4baa-9b23-472af36f0e66)

**Intersect**: All common rows that are present between the two tables are selected and displayed in the output. In the image given below, you can see that only the yellow record is displayed in the output.

![Step 4](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/37ecd7a4-c836-450d-8980-439fcf41e977)


**Table 1 minus Table 2**: In the output, **all the records in Table 1 are selected and those in Table 1 and Table 2 are removed**. In the image given below, you can see that all the records in Table 1 are selected except for the yellow row as it is present in both Tables 1 and 2.

![Step 5](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/3c4b677a-d562-4097-a269-7bd91c991c1c)


**Table 2 minus Table 1**: In the output, **all the records in Table 2 are selected and those in Table 2 and Table 1 are removed.** In the following image, you can see that all the records in Table 2 are selected except for the yellow row as it is present in both Tables 1 and 2.

![Step 6](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/15497a6c-68c7-4faf-b80e-2fbb8cbef299)


### Sub-queries or CTE:

- Helps to **make the queries modular** and the approach provides a simple way to solve and understand complex SQL problems.

### JOINS:

- Used to combine two or more tables **(horizontal stacking)** and is very useful as most of the data is distributed across multiple tables with the help of primary and foreign keys.
- It is also important to note the **type of join and level of output**.
    - `LEFT join,` `RIGHT join`, `CROSS join` and `INNER join` are a few types of joins that are used frequently.

### Views:

- This concept is used when the SQL query is very lengthy and complex. The approach is to break the code into snippets and each snippet acts as **temporary storage space.**

## RANK

The types of ranks are as follows:

- Rank: It gives the same rank if a clash is present between two rows and then skips the next rank.
- Dense rank: It gives the same rank if a clash is present between two rows and does not skip the next rank.
- Row number: It gives a unique rank for all the rows, even if a clash is present.
- Percent rank: It gives a percentile score which is distributed from 0 to 1. In this type of rank, you can understand what percentile does each category in a particular column belong to.

```sql
RANK() OVER 

(PARTITION BY <expression>[{,<expression>…}]

ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], [{,<expression>…}])
```

OVER :- Clause is used to provide additional context to the rank function. 

PARTITION BY :- Helps set the context of group within the ranking has to be computed. 

ORDER BY :- Defines the field(s) whose order is considered to compute the rank.

## FRAMES

In frames there is no difference in what operation is being carried about, but rather it sets the window size on which the operation is to be applied. The two major components of frames are:

- Beginning of the frame
- End of the frame

In the following image, you can analyze that the frame clause is categorized into two parts:

- **frame units:** The granularity level at which you are applying the frame
- **frame extent:** Setting range for the frame. There are various methods to provide the frame starting point, frame ending point and the frame in between (start and end).
    - These can be done by various types of operations that can be applied on a frame. In the image given below, you can view the various operations that are performed.

![Step7](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/4cd8492f-c6b3-4578-9bdc-2c9db87c1071)


Let's now discuss the various operations in the following manner:

- **N preceding rows:** The frame contains the current row and N rows before or preceding the current row. Whatever operation or filter that is present in the SQL query is applied on this frame. In the following image, the small yellow arrow represents its frame size.
- **M following rows:** The frame contains the current row and M rows after or following the current row. Whatever operation or filter is present in the SQL query, it is applied on this frame. In the following image, the small blue arrow represents its frame size.
- **Unbounded preceding:** The frame contains the current row and all the rows before or preceding the current row. Whatever operation or filter is present in the SQL query, is applied on this frame. In the image given below, the big yellow arrow represents its frame size.
- **Unbounded following:** The frame contains the current row and all the rows after or following the current row. Whatever operation or filter is present in the SQL query is applied on this frame. In the image, the big blue arrow represents its frame size.

![Step 8](https://github.com/mangogeeks/mangogeeks.github.io/assets/99791294/b3985465-2f10-4095-8929-c4440b5e2c3f)


### Examples

**Problem statement 1**: The SQL query calculates the average sales for seven preceding days from the current row for a particular store. 

You can see the keyword **PRECEDING** used and the number seven before it.

 

```sql
AVG(sales) OVER (partition BY store ORDER BY data rows 7 PRECEDING) AS ma_sales.
```

**Problem statement 2**: The SQL query calculates the total sum (km) covered for all the preceding records from the current row for a particular car number. 

You can see the keyword **UNBOUNDED PRECEDING** used to indicate that there is no preceding limit.

```sql
SUM(km) OVER (partition BY car_no ORDER BY service_date rows UNBOUNDED PRECEDING ) AS total_km;
```

**Problem statement 3**: The SQL query calculates the total amount spent between the current year and past three years for a particular department. 

You can see the keyword **BETWEEN** used, with the current row and three preceding it.

```sql
SUM(spends) OVER (partition BY department ORDER BY years rows BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING
AND
CURRENT row) AS currentandprev3yearsspends
```

## LEAD and LAG

- **Lead**: A function that is used to gain the values from the next set of rows for the current row
- **Lag**: A function that is is used to gain the values from the previous set of rows for the current row

These functions are very useful in fetching future or previous events that are related to the current event. The syntax for lead function is as follows:

`LEAD(expr[, offset[, default]])`

`OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)`

The expression **expr[, offset[, default]]** represents the column for which you want to apply the lead values and the expression **OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)** indicates the window specifications where you will add partitions, ranks, etc. 

Similarly, the syntax for lag function is as follows:

`LAG(expr[, offset[, default]])`

`OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)`
